I'm Amir Masoud Almasi, often called Sina, and I'm currently a Data Science and Engineering master's student at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. With a foundation in Mathematics and Applications and hands-on experience as a junior data analyst at MCI, Iran's largest technology company, Iâ€™m driven by the power of data to tell stories and reveal hidden meanings. 

My previous work spans a range of impactful projects, from building recommendation systems to designing data visualizations, each aimed at making complex data accessible and meaningful. Whether it's finding patterns in large datasets or turning raw data into actionable insights, my focus is on uncovering value in numbers and solving practical problems. 

Welcome to my GitHub, where I document my journey and share my projects!
